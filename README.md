## Description
The Nios II Assembly program's objective is to use the Altera DE0 FPGA Board and program it to flash the upper 5 LEDs every 0.25 seconds and to respond to a push button to toggle the lowest LED using hardware interups. The timer and pushbutton interups were used on the parallel port to perform the task and the code is written in accordance with the Intel Altera documentation and follows the Nios II assembly language conventions.
